@*<p>This online math training site provides all levels of contest questions to enhance the mathematics skills for interested students.</p>*@
@*<p>We also seek to build a social platform for kids to train and work within a team, motivating the members to dig out their full potentials.</p>*@
@*<p>The site is still in the trial run status for function enhancement, there are over 300 questions in the test library covering various grades, more will be posted over time.</p>*@
@*<p>The primary focus of this stage is to provide test questions for the students in the elementary school (grade 1-5), </p>
<p>We will group students into the 1-2 grade team and 3-5 grade team</p>*@
@*<p>The usage of this site will be limited to be a small group of socially connected kids so that they can train, compete and interact with each other.</p>*@
@*<p>We are planning to introduce more media features supported by the web, may transform the testing process to a team based treasury-hunting game, ideas are welcome</p>*@
